IMPORTANT:
The App need the GitHub Access Token which allow You to send more than 60 requests per our and authorize them.
Without it the App wouldn't be work. I get the Access Token from the database lokalize on my own server. You can import the database (DataBaseCopy.sql.gz file) and config Your connection in the file App/helpers/gitAccessToken.php or define Your own fixed Access Token (yourAccessToken variable) in the init function of App file: App/GitHubApp.js

curiosity:
If You generate Your API Access Token and define it in string variable in the code, it will be automaticly remove after send Your code on GitHub.
GitHub check all files and match it with generated Access Tokens, and when it find any, it will remove it in the GitHub Accounts settings for safety resons.
