Angles Handle is One Page Project made by Aleksander Bejma, AbreSolutions company CEO&owner.
On this WebSite You find GitHub Angular repositories Contributors.

Live WebSite is working on: http://github.abresolutions.com/

Posible Actions:
1. View All Angular Unique Contributors.
1.a. Order Angular Contributors by:
- Number of Angular Contributions
- Number of public Repositories
- Number of public Gists
- Number of Followers
1. b. Search user by his login
1. c. Change contributors displayed per page from 10 to 100.
2. View each Angular Contributor details with his repositories.
3. View each repositories details with its contributors.
4. View all Angular repositories.
5. View Angular Organization information.
6. View Contact and About SubPage.

Things that still need (by ran out of time):
1. Back button back only to the previous View - it should be an array with all steps made by user.
2. GitHub API allows to ask only 100 requests per page. Others pages are in the headers. We should get all Links from headers and for each of them get the http requests.

Things easy to do, but nice to have:
1. Go to the View with user followers and Gists.
2. Map of the User location (if it is defined of course) and form to contact (if user e-mail address is defined).
3. Contact form and map in the Contact SubPage.

Things to improve:
1. Layout - For mobile devices. It is implemented but should be polished.
2. Animations. I focused on the easy to use and functional project but a little bit animations could be fine.

Summary:
1. Project is based on JavaScript with Angular library. Template is based on Bootstrap and my own clear HTML and CSS.
2. The idea for the layout is mine (OK, my Girlfriend too).
3. In project I used 2 external modules: for pagination and for loader while requests are loading. I changed in them styles and in loader module I added one variable.
